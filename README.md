# ClassFit - booking system

## About ClassFit
ClassFit is an online booking system for a local gym that allows the coaches to create classes/event and allows the users to book on to these and log their results/scores.

This project will be used as my capstone project for the Code Institute skills bootcamp. It will be a full stack python django application.

The target user for this project will be a gym owner who runs a gym like the CrossFit gym I attend. This is where they have regular classes and times and these can be managed by the owner and their clients can reserve spaces and log progress.
